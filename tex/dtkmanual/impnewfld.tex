Implementing a new field in \DTK{} is an easy task. The file \texttt{src/\-com\-mon/\-cust\-fld-wfn\-class.\-cpp}
contains the implementation of a dummy field, which can be easily changed in order to implement
the new field.

\begin{figure}
\lstinputlisting[language=C++, firstline=4, lastline=64]{custfld-wfnclass.cpp}
\caption{Implementation of the scalar dummy field $\rho^2$, and the vector dummy field
$\nabla\rho/\rho$.}
\label{fig:codecustfld}
\end{figure}

For instance, in Fig. \ref{fig:codecustfld} we show how to implement the scalar field $\rho^2$
and the vector field $\nabla\rho/\rho$. The functions evalCustomScalarField and evalCustomVectorField
are already integrated with \DTK's programs. Therefore, computing new user-implemented fields
is, after re-compilation of the suite, almost straightforward. 

In version \dtkversion, this easy implementation of new fields is limited to the type of
new field. If the new field is derivative of any combination of the already implemented fields,
then the implementation is almost trivial. Otherwise, it requires a bit more time and effort to
implement it.

More information about the complete set of functions of the gaussWaveFunc class can be found by
installing doxygen in your system. After this, in \texttt{/top/src} type
\begin{lstlisting}
$make develdocs
\end{lstlisting}
Here we have assumed that \texttt{/top} is the directory where the source code of \DTK{} is 
located. After executing the above command, a file named \texttt{/top/src/devdoc/html/in\-dex.\-html}
should be present. The html file has the developer's documentation created by doxygen.
