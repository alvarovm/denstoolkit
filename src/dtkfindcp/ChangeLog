=====================================================================
*** Version 0.1.3 ***
=====================================================================

   Bug fixed: the program finds the correct number of critical
              points of the porphirine.

=====================================================================
*** Version 0.1.2 ***
=====================================================================

--> Bug fixed: The program does not loop ad infinitum for the file
      c60-321g.wfx

KNOWN BUGS:
      The program loops indefinitely when seeking CCPs for the file
      porphyrin-321g.wfn... It remains at 100% of RCPs

=====================================================================
*** Version 0.1.1 ***
=====================================================================

--> The atom color palette/scheme has been changed. Now the color
      palette is the same as used in the JMol package.

KNOWN BUGS:
    The program loops indefinitely when seeking RCPs for file 
    c60-321g.wfx. It scans 150% of BPCs!

=====================================================================
*** Version 0.1.0 ***
=====================================================================

--> The output of the program has been changed. Now the log file
      no longer contains information of the bond gradient paths.
--> A new file is created, with format cpx. This file contains all
      the information of coordinates of critical points and 
      bond gradient paths.
--> The default radius for all critical points is changed to 0.1,
      as opposed to 0.25

Known BUGS:

--> The program has some troubles with the calculation of the critical
        points for the file LiH-6311Gdp.wfx (LOL CPS). 
        The reason is unknown. Perhaps high gradients near the nuclei.

Corrected BUGS:
--> The program has some troubles with the calculation of the gradient
        paths for the file LiH-6311Gdp.wfx. 
        The reason is unknown.               ****CORRECTED****
--> The algorithm for finding the ACP's does not work properly
        for all nuclear positions. High gradient/small region
        changes may be the cause.        ****CORRECTED****


=====================================================================
*** Version 0.0.8 ***
=====================================================================

--> THe bond path now includes a point that was missing, this corrects
      the funny effects that appeared in plots generated by
      dtkdemat1.



=====================================================================
*** Version 0.0.7 ***
=====================================================================

--> Some extra options are included in the pov file. Now the user
      can modify the pov file for setting the view angle for the
      final rendered image. The view angles are the same as in 
      the "set view rotX,rotZ" option for gnuplot.
      Also another angle is added.



=====================================================================
*** Version 0.0.6 ***
=====================================================================

--> Added an option for saving the coordinates of atoms, critical
      points and bond paths into three files. The files will be
      saved by using option -m

=====================================================================
*** Version 0.0.5 ***
=====================================================================

--> Limited support for cygwin

--> In the pov file, now the user can choose a few settings for the
      final rendering. This is done via #declare XXX=true/false;

=====================================================================
*** Version 0.0.4 ***
=====================================================================

Some changes to the help menu and support for long command line
options (e.g. --help, and --version).

=====================================================================
*** Version 0.0.3 ***
=====================================================================

--> The program now calculates the bond gradient paths for the 
      electron density.

Known bugs:
  --> The program has some troubles with the calculation of the gradient
        paths for the file LiH-6311Gdp.wfx. The reason is unknown.
--> The algorithm for finding the ACP's does not work properly
        for all nuclear positions. High gradient/small region
        changes may be the cause

=====================================================================
*** Version 0.0.2 ***
=====================================================================

--> Improvements on the algorithms for finding cps. The program now
      correctly finds rho cp for benzene and epi, epigalo.
--> The class wavefunction now correctly reads files with a number
      of primitives equal to a multiple of 20
--> The class bondnetwork foresees the cases where 
      maxBondDist have not been determined due to non of the
      atoms are linked (according to the Van Der Walls sum criteria,
      i.e., the algorithm for drawing CPK/ball&stick molecules)

Known bugs:
  --> The algorithm for finding the ACP's does not work properly
        for all nuclear positions. High gradient/small region
        changes may be the cause


=====================================================================
*** Version 0.0.1 ***
=====================================================================

First beta release of the program.

Known bugs:
  --> The algorithm for finding the ACP's does not work properly
        for all nuclear positions. High gradient/small region
        changes may be the cause
  --> Odd critical points appear for molecules such as benzene
  --> The program do not find the critical points (rho) for 
        epi.wfn. This bug was found after the last changes in
        the algorithm for adding CPs and (related to the signature
        test and the initialization variable 1.0e50)
